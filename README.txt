OK, I hate disclaimers, but there you. Pretty much it is "Don't steal my work, and if you change my app, give it to me."
Now on with the fun stuff.

Scrawl was the very first note taking app on the Mac App Store with iCloud support.
I have provided this code so you can learn how to implement iCloud support yourself, and see a working demo.
iCloud is very buggy, so that is why Scrawl stores notes both locally and in iCloud.
Scrawl is NSDocument based, with some exceptions. Some unwanted changes were made to get it approved by Apple.

Thanks, and have fun!
